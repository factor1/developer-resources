# Deploying A WordPress Site To Flywheel 
Flywheel is a dedicated WordPress host that we use on a bulk of our sites. The only downside to Flywheel is that we do not have SSH access, so we cannot just push our theme changes via git from the command line. Since Flywheel is a dedicated WordPress host, they have a super simple 1-click install of WordPress which can speed up the launch/staging process.

## Setting Up WordPress
